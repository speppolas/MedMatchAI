    "description": "PURPOSE\n\nTo demonstrate if delayed timing of surgery after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy actually affects pathological complete response (pCR) and reflects on disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) rather than standard timing. Eight weeks are the current standard interval to surgery after neoadjuvant treatment, while 12 weeks represent the \"minimum\" longer time interval to determine further tumor modifications and the \"a priori\" choice to avoid hypothetical surgical detrimental effect (postoperative complications related to radiation therapy).\n\nPrimary Endpoint\n\n* pCR\n\nSecondary Endpoints\n\n* DFS\n* OS\n* QoL (quality of Life)\n\nSite Eligibility\n\nThe trial is a multicenter collaboration, involving all those centers able to provide the standard of cure for locally advanced rectal cancer. All the involved centers have to respect the following criteria:\n\n* Site able to perform robotic-assisted and standard laparoscopic rectal cancer surgery and TaTME (transanal total mesorectal excision)\n* Site able to provide a preoperative work up according to the work up criteria specified in this trial\n* Site able to provide standard neoadjuvant treatment, both chemo and radiation therapy, according to the criteria specified in this trial\n* Predicted capability to recruit a minimum of 15 patients per year to the trial.\n\nRandomization will take place after consent is obtained and after patients have completed their baseline patient reported questionnaires. Patient consent and randomization will take place as close to the date of start of the neoadjuvant treatment as possible and must be no more than 30 days prior to planned treatment.",

Also, estimating prospectively differences in residual disease between the two study arms of the FIL-Rouge will provide an important biologic tool to validate the concept of dose-intensification within the ABVD therapeutic platform.\n\nThis study aims at the prospective validation of the concept of the liquid biopsy as a biomarker for disease response assessment in cHL. The patients enrolled in the FIL-Rouge clinical trial at the centers participating in this study and consenting to the biological study FIL-RougeBIO will be considered for this study. After providing written informed consent, relevant patients will be evaluated for detecting cancer gene mutations in ctDNA (Circulating Tumor DNA) for measuring residual disease. All clinical data useful for data analyses of this study will derive from the FIL-Rouge clinical trial.\n\nGiven the non-interventional design of the study, project participants will not have immediate potential benefits.The enrollment in FIL-RougeBIO will parallel the original protocol until reaching the 500 programmed patients. The results of this study could benefit future patients with the same condition.",

    "title": "Hypercoagulation Screening as Innovative Tool for Risk Assessment, Early Diagnosis and Prognosis in Cancer",
    "phase": "Not Applicable",
    "description": "There is a complex, mutual relationship between cancer and thrombosis. Indeed, the tumor has the capacity to activate the hemostatic system and this leads to an increased thrombotic risk in cancer patients. Even in the absence of clinical manifestations, cancer patients are commonly characterized by hemostatic abnormalities, recognized only by laboratory testing, which define the 'hypercoagulable state'. Of interest, hypercoagulation has been repeatedly reported to be associated with tumor progression and poor prognosis in various carcinomas. On the other hand, thrombotic event can represent the first signal of the presence of an occult tumor. These findings suggest that the coagulant pathway might play a role in the preclinical phase of cancer. The investigators hypothesize that a persistent, subclinical activation of the hemostatic system in an otherwise healthy subject, may predispose not only to thrombosis, but also to tumor formation and spreading. A major problem in primary cancer prevention is the lack of effective predictive markers of the disease. The HYPERCAN is an ongoing prospective Italian multicenter study organized around two tightly-interconnected research programs aiming to: 1_the assessment of thrombotic markers as a tool for cancer risk prediction in two large populations of healthy subjects, i.e. a group of healthy blood donors of Bergamo and Milano Provinces and a subgroup of Moli-sani subjects of the Molise region; and 2_ the evaluation whether thrombotic markers and/or the occurrence of overt thrombosis (or disseminated intravascular coagulation) may be prognostic of cancer disease outcomes (i.e. overall survival, progression free survival in metastatic cancer, disease free survival in limited disease) in cancer patients with different types of solid tumors (i.e. breast, lung and gastrointestinal cancers).\n\nTherefore, the assessment of cancer risk occurrence in healthy individuals might be useful for anticipation of cancer diagnosis. In addition, the results of this study might help to evaluate whether thrombotic markers may be prognostic of cancer outcomes independently of the disease extension.",
